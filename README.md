# Order-Up
Yes, chef! It's time to get some food out the door!
## Process
The goal for this project is to make a game called Order Up, which asks the player (the chef) to fulfill orders by clicking on the ingredients required for the meal on the meal ticket. They then submit (or send out) the order, and earn a tip!

I created a low-fidelity, general layout for this project using the Notability app.

And then began mocking up a higher fidelity wireframe using Photoshop to explore color options and general design.

I also created a possible introductory/title screen for the game:

## General Game Rules
### MVP
1. The game will feature visuals of food, that can be clicked
2. Use JS to build item objects and their ingredients
3. Create random functions for the delivery of the meal orders to the screen
4. Use DOM manipulation to present orders to the screen
5. Validate correct ingredients are selected
6. Add score (tip) to screen- $5 for complicated order, $3 for single or easy item
7. At least 5 rounds for this level.

### Stretch Goals
1. Add a timer
2. Add an indicator for incorrect ingredient selection (perhaps a red flash)
3. Add button 'pushing' effects
4. Add a gloved hand as the mouse clicker
5. Add addition level(s)
  - Increased number of items per ticket
  - timer set for each order
  - missed orders deduct from total tip
  - make 'submit' button available for entirety of game
  - do not indicate when incorrect selections are selected
  - deduct when incorrect orders placed
6. Add music or sound effects
