# Order-Up
Yes, chef! It's time to get some food out the door!
## Process
The goal for this project is to make a game called Order Up, which asks the player (the chef) to fulfill orders by clicking on the ingredients required for the meal on the meal ticket. They then submit (or send out) the order, and earn a tip!

I created a low-fidelity, general layout for this project using the Notability app.

And then began mocking up a higher fidelity wireframe using Photoshop to explore color options and general design.

I also created a possible introductory/title screen for the game:
